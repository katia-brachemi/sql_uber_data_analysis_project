# 📊 SQL Exploratory Data Analysis UBER Project

## Overview

This project showcases an **exploratory data analysis (EDA) workflow in SQL**.  
The objective is to query, structure, and interpret a relational dataset in order to highlight operational trends and customer behavior patterns.  

The dataset sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yashdevladdha/uber-ride-analytics-dashboard/data), contains records of Uber rides during 2024.  
It provides visibility into booking activity, trip outcomes, payment preferences, cancellation dynamics, and overall service performance.
